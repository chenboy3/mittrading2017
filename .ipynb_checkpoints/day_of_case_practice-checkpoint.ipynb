    "This is a starter notebook that will be provided to you on competition day that provides boilerplate code to load all of the data (both the sample data and the data for each case as they go live). Since this notebook is mainly for you to get acquianted with loading/manipulating data, you will be able to access the sample data and data from any case. However on competition day, you will only be able to access data from the current case that is live. If you want to use a different statistical analysis framework, you can also download the zip files containing all the data that can be accessed from this notebook from the website: http://18.216.4.171:8080/ and write similar boilerplate code yourself. On the day of the competition, you will be able to access the sample data and data from each case as it goes live as a downloadable zip file."
